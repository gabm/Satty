# <img src="assets/satty.svg" height="42"> Satty: Modern Screenshot Annotation.

Satty is a screenshot annotation tool inspired by [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).

![](assets/usage.gif)

Satty has been created to provide the following improvements over existing screenshot annotation tools:

- very simple and easy to understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- extremely smooth rendering thanks to HW acceleration (OpenGL)
- working on wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- minimal, modern looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita
- be a playground for new features (post window selection, post paint editing, ...)

## Install

Thanks to our package maintainers, Satty is available for many distributions on Linux and BSD:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/satty.svg)](https://repology.org/project/satty/versions)

### Specifics
| Distribution | Command | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gentoo | `emerge -av satty` | You need guru overlay (see [wiki](https://github.com/gabm/Satty/wiki/Gentoo-Guru)). Pending [PR](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/33908) |
| Alpine Linux | `apk add satty` | Available in [Alpine Community](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=satty&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=) |

### Prebuilt Sources

You can download a prebuilt binary for x86-64 on the [Satty Releases](https://github.com/gabm/satty/releases) page.

## Usage

Start by providing a filename or a screenshot via stdin and annotate using the available tools. Save to clipboard or file when finished. Tools and Interface have been kept simple.

All configuration is done either at the config file in `XDG_CONFIG_DIR/.config/satty/config.toml` or via the command line interface. In case both are specified, the command line options always override the configuration file.

### Shortcuts

- `Enter`: as configured (see below), default: copy-to-clipboard
- `Esc`: as configured (see below), default: exit
- `Ctrl+C`: Save to clipboard
- `Ctrl+S`: Save to specified output file
- `Ctrl+Shift+S`: Save using file dialog <sup>0.20.0</sup>
- `Ctrl+T`: Toggle toolbars
- `Ctrl+Y`: Redo
- `Ctrl+Z`: Undo

#### Tool Selection Shortcuts (configurable) <sup>0.20.0</sup>
Default single-key shortcuts:
- `p`: Pointer tool
- `c`: Crop tool
- `b`: Brush tool
- `i`: Line tool
- `z`: Arrow tool
- `r`: Rectangle tool
- `e`: Ellipse tool
- `t`: Text tool
- `m`: Numbered Marker tool
- `u`: Blur tool
- `g`: Highlight tool

### Tool Modifiers and Keys

- Arrow: Hold `Shift` to make arrow snap to 15° steps
- Ellipse: Hold `Alt` to center the ellipse around origin, hold `Shift` for a circle
- Highlight: Hold `Ctrl` to switch between block and freehand mode (default configurable, see below), hold Shift for a square (if the default mode is block) or a straight line (if the default mode is freehand)
- Line: Hold `Shift` to make line snap to 15° steps
- Rectangle: Hold `Alt` to center the rectangle around origin, hold `Shift` for a square
- Text: Press `Shift+Enter` to insert line break, combine `Ctrl` with `Left` or `Right` for word jump or `Ctrl` with `Backspace` or `Delete` for word delete. Press `Enter` or switch to another tool to accept input, press `Escape` to discard entered text. `Home` and `End` go to the start/end of current line or previous/next line if already on first/last character of line (automatic wrapping is not considered for this). `Ctrl` with `Home`/`End` jumps to start/end of text buffer.

### IME <sup>0.20.0</sup>

Satty supports IME via GTK with and without preediting. Please note, at this point Satty has no proper fallback font handling so the font used needs to contain the entered glyphs.

### wlroots based compositors (Sway, Wayfire, River, ...)

You can bind a key to the following command:

```
grim -g "$(slurp -o -r -c '#ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/satty-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

Hyprland users must escape the `#` with another `#`:

```
grim -g "$(slurp -o -r -c '##ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/satty-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

Please note we're using ppm in both examples. Compared to png, ppm is uncompressed and this can save time.

### Other examples

#### Image Resize

Satty does not provide a resize mechanism other than cropping. But you can pipe the result to other tools such as ImageMagick:

```
grim -g "0,0 3840x2160" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --output-filename - | convert -resize 50% - out.png
```

#### Sway mode

Add this to your ~/.config/sway/config.
It needs `grim` and `slurp`.
```sh
# screenshots
# inspiration: https://www.reddit.com/r/swaywm/comments/ghnlea/comment/fqnzxkx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
set $satty satty -f - --initial-tool=arrow --copy-command=wl-copy --actions-on-escape="save-to-clipboard,exit" --brush-smooth-history-size=5 --disable-notifications
set $printscreen_mode 'printscreen (r:region, f:full, w:window)'
mode $printscreen_mode {
    bindsym r exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && grim -t ppm -g "$(slurp -d)" - | $satty
    bindsym f exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && grim -t ppm - | $satty
    bindsym w exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r '.. | select(.focused?) | .rect | "\(.x),\(.y) \(.width)x\(.height)"' | grim -t ppm -g - - | $satty

    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}
bindsym $mod+Shift+p mode $printscreen_mode
```

## Build from source
